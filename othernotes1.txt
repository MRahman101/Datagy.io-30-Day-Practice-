DAY 4:
-This is the subject about booleans. This data type has onlt "True" and "False".
-You can also see the type of boolean a value is. False is any value of 0 (or 0.0), a value set to 'False' or 'None', and an empty sequence object. 
-Next, there are operators. These are the folowing: '=='(equal to), '<','>', '<=' (less than or equal to), '!=' (not equal to), '>='.
-You can accurately compare ints and floats with '==' but not so much with something like '<'.
-And, you can use the ord() funtion to see the ASCII value of any character. 

-Operators can be used with logical operators. Such as 'and', 'not', 'or'.

-There is 'if', 'else' and 'elif' (combination of 'else' and 'if') used to control flow in the program. 

"is" and "is not" are used to determine if two objects are allocated in the same space in memory. "id" can be used to see where in the memory an item is stored.
